This is always a hassle, as I&amp;rsquo;m switching contexts, logins, and hardware multiple times per day. To reduce friction I decided to write down some notes about my laptop setup. This is mainly for me to re-use in the future, but I figured this might help others in similar situations.
Browser: Firefox I use Firefox for web browsing, mainly due to its Container Tab feature and Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s focus on privacy.</description></item></channel></rss>
